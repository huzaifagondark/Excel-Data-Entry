PYTHON DATA ENTRY FORM WITH TKINTER AND OPENPYXL:

In my case, everything starts with my quest to automate biostatistics but this time the project was made to satisfy my curious personality

In the same course, we've been assigned a task to generate a Google form; complete the relevant responses, and discuss the results in the class

As required, I've generated the form but what got me excited is the 'view in excel sheet function' 

how is it that every time a person completes the response their information automatically comes into my Excel database with the date and the timestamps

It poked my curiosity bubble and these questions were raised in my mind...

-what is the functionality behind it?
-can it be done using Python?
-can I upload it on Github to Flex?

after making a mindmap on Notepad I got to work and found this amazing tutorial on YouTube 'Python tkinter data entry form', 'codewithhala'

basically what the program does is take entries from the user and store it in Excel in real-time 

additionally, I've added the function to show all the entries in my tkinter window like an Excel spreadsheet

using the forest module I've also added the data and night mode theme to make the GUI appealing to the user...
